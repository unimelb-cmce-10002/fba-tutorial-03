By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

* Explain how different `ggplot2` visualization techniques reveal patterns in the Melbourne housing market that would be difficult to see in tables or raw numbers.
* Use `ggplot2` to create bar plots, histograms, and scatterplots that analyze relationships between property prices, location, and dwelling types.
* Apply transformations such as log scales, proportions, and faceting to improve the interpretability of price distributions and spatial trends.
* Customize `ggplot2` plots using themes, color palettes, and annotations to enhance clarity and storytelling.
* Evaluate and compare visualization approaches, identifying which effectively communicate insights about housing price trends and spatial patterns.
* Build and refine a visual analysis workflow that could inform practical decision-making for home buyers, investors, or urban planners
