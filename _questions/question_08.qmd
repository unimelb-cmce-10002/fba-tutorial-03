### Exercise 8: Synthesizing the Findings

If you were presenting these results in a business meeting, how would you explain the key takeaways? Structure your summary to include:

* What you analyzed (data, variables)
* What you found (key insights from the visualizations)
* What decisions could be made based on this information?

Hereâ€™s one possible (long) answer:

**What We Looked At**

We analyzed housing listings from Melbourne to explore three key questions:

- Where are houses being listed, and how does this vary by region?
- How do prices differ between dwelling types (Houses, Units, Townhouses)?
- How does distance from the CBD relate to house prices?

**What We Found** 
Listing Activity by Region:

- Some metro regions (e.g., Northern and Western Metro) had a larger share of house listings than others. Presenting these as proportions made the comparison clearer, especially for less active regions.

Price Differences by Dwelling Type:

- Houses had the highest prices on average and the widest spread.
- Units were more affordable and tightly clustered in price.
- Townhouses sat in between.

These differences became much clearer when we adjusted for the skew in price data and focused on the shape of each distribution, not just raw numbers.

Price and Distance from the CBD:

- For Houses, prices generally decline as distance increases â€” but not in a straight line. Prices drop off quickly closer to the CBD, then flatten out. A curved trendline helped us see that nuance.

**What This Helps Us Understand**

These visuals donâ€™t tell us everything, but they provide a starting point for smarter conversations:

- If you're pricing or positioning properties, it's helpful to understand how type and location shape price expectations.
- Regional variation in listing volume could flag where market activity is strongest â€” or where supply may be tight. Thatâ€™s worth exploring further.
- The priceâ€“distance relationship aligns with what we might expect: proximity adds value, but only up to a point. Knowing where that value levels off could inform development or marketing strategies.
